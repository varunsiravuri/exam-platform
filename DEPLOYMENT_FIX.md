# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Fix Netlify Functions Deployment

## The Problem
Your Netlify Functions are not deployed or responding. This is why you're getting "Database Offline" errors.

## Immediate Solution

### Step 1: Check Netlify Dashboard
1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Click on "Functions" tab
3. Check if you see any functions listed
4. If no functions are shown, they weren't deployed

### Step 2: Force Redeploy with Functions
1. Go to "Deploys" tab in Netlify
2. Click "Trigger deploy" â†’ "Clear cache and deploy site"
3. Wait for deployment to complete
4. Check "Functions" tab again

### Step 3: Verify Functions Are Working
After redeployment, test this URL:
```
https://test.pinnit.in/.netlify/functions/health-check
```

You should see a JSON response like:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Netlify Functions are working!",
  "timestamp": "2024-06-24T...",
  "environment": {
    "hasSupabaseUrl": true,
    "hasSupabaseKey": true,
    "supabaseConfigured": true
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Check Environment Variables
If functions work but database still fails:
1. Go to Site settings â†’ Environment variables
2. Verify these exist:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
3. If missing, add them and redeploy

## Quick Test Checklist
- [ ] Functions appear in Netlify dashboard
- [ ] Health check URL returns JSON response
- [ ] Environment variables are set
- [ ] Database Manager shows "Connected"

## If Still Not Working
1. Check Netlify build logs for errors
2. Verify `netlify.toml` is in root directory
3. Ensure `netlify/functions/` folder exists
4. Try deleting and recreating the site in Netlify
